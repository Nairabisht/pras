        <h1>What Is K-Pop?</h1>
        <p>Korean popular music, or K-pop, is a popular genre of music originating from South Korea. K-pop songs contain many musical influences, such as hip-hop, electronic dance, jazz, and rock, performed by groups featuring anywhere from four to 21 members. Aspiring K-pop stars undergo intense training together, learning dance choreography and other skills until they are ready to perform live for the first time.
        
        K-pop is one part of the “Korean Wave”—also called Hallyu, a term referring to the popularity of Korean pop culture and Korean TV shows, music, and movies across Asia and other parts of the world.

    <h1>A Brief History of Modern K-Pop</h1>
    <p>
    
    The origins of modern K-pop date back to 1987, a year of rampant political change that led to South Korea’s
    democratization. In response to the increase of Western cultural influences during the late ’80s and early ’90s, musical
    acts began merging elements of rap, rock, and jazz with the contemporary sounds of Korean music. Here’s a look at the
    evolution of the music genre:
    
    Seo Taiji and the Boys usher in modern K-pop. Modern K-pop emerged in the ’90s when Seo Taiji and the Boys released
    their breakout track, “I Know,” which topped the Korean music charts for 17 weeks. The band’s sound blended American New
    Jack Swing with contemporary pop, a sound that eclipsed the slower ballads that were popular in the country at the time.
    The group cultivated a large following and inspired a slew of bands with a similar sound, giving birth to Idol Culture,
    an umbrella term for the fandom that follows popular musical acts (also known as Idols) in Japan and Korea.
    Late ’90s K-pop boom. After the success of Seo Taiji and the Boys, entertainment agencies began recruiting more young
    performers for intensive idol training to fill the demand for new talent. This training model was an offshoot of a
    similar business model used in J-pop, or Japanese pop, leading to the creation of bands like H.O.T., Baby Vox, Fin.K.L,
    g.o.d., and Sechs Kies.
    K-pop goes international. In the 2000s, K-pop continued to grow with bands like Big Bang, who debuted in 2006, receiving
    waves of critical acclaim. Over the last decade, K-pop became more popular with mainstream Western audiences, largely
    due to the massive success of BTS (short for Bangtan Boys), a popular boy band that formed in 2010. In 2017, the group
    was the first in the genre to perform at the American Music Awards, an achievement that introduced them to millions of
    Western viewers. The group has continued to chart internationally, breaking records, selling out tours, and releasing
    their first English-language single, “Dynamite,” which topped the Billboard charts upon its release in 2020    </p>
